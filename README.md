#### Tech Stack
- [![MongoDB][MongoDB]][MongoDB-url]
- [![Express][Express.js]][Express-url]
- [![React][React.js]][React-url]
- [![Node][Node.js]][Node-url]

#### Libraries/APIs
- mongoose (MongoDB for database)
- openai (OpenAI API for vibe generation)
- bcrypt (password hashing)
- jwt (user token generation)
- multer (file storage)
- cors (middleware between frontend and backend)

### Description/Motivation
CSCO is a social media web application built with the MERN tech stack. Users can create authenticated accounts and post images (either through URL or file upload) onto their profile. Using OpenAI’s GPT 4 Vision Preview API, CSCO automatically generates “vibe” words for each image. Users can search for posts by searching for other users or by searching by image “vibe”.

This project was built for UCLA’s CS 35L course.


## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```
### Installing the frontend 
1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/cs35l-group/csco
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Installing the backend
1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Jaysontian/csco-api
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Create an Open AI API Key (preferably with a GPT 4 account) at [https://platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) 
4. Create a 32-byte JWT hash by running 
	```sh
	openssl rand -hex 32 
	```
5. Create a MongoDB deployment and save the connection string and replace `<password>` with your database password

6. Create a `.env` file in the main project folder and enter your API Key in it
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API KEY’;
   const JWT_SECRET = 'ENTER YOUR JWT HASH’;
   const MONGO_URI = 'ENTER YOUR MONGO CONNECTION STRING’; 
   ```
### Launch on localhost

1. Launch the backend
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
	- If backend connection to MongoDB fails, you might have to go to your MongoDB database page and enable all IP Addresses

2. Launch the frontend repo
   ```sh
	npm start
   ```
